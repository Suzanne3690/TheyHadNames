# TheyHadNames

Using R and R-markdown with the African Names Database from [The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database](http://www.slavevoyages.org/tast/index.faces)

This is work in progress...

So far, I have done three exploratory analyses:  

* There Were Teenagers  

* There Were Children  

* There Were Mothers
  
  
Along the way, I have discovered that the source dataset is not tidy -- and some of the "untidiness" was not obvious until I got into the analyses. So, I have held off on "tidying" for now... for I will surely find more.
