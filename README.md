# TheyHadNames

Using R and R-markdown with the African Names Database from [The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database](http://www.slavevoyages.org)

This is work in progress...

So far, I have done three exploratory analyses:  

* There Were Teenagers - uncovers an interesting artifact of the way ages were recorded

* There Were Children - identification of children 

* There Were Mothers - identification of mothers
  
  
Along the way, I have discovered that the source dataset is not tidy -- and some of the "untidiness" was not obvious until I got into the analyses. So, I have held off on "tidying" for now... for I will probably find more.
